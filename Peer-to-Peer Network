Peer to peer (P2P) refers to a decentralized network model where each participant 
can act as both a client and a server. This means that participants can share 
resources and communicate directly with each other without the need for intermediaries. 
P2P networks are often used for file sharing, cryptocurrency transactions, and 
other distributed applications.
